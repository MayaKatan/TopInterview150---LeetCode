LeetCode Problem: Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order,
remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once.
The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.

The final result should be:
- The first k elements of nums contain the unique elements in the order they were present initially.
- The remaining elements of nums are not important.
- Return k, the number of unique elements.

Note: You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
