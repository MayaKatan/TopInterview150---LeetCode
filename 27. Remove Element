Remove Element (LeetCode)

Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place.
The order of the elements may be changed.

Return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.

Requirements:
- Modify nums such that the first k elements contain the elements which are not equal to val.
- The remaining elements of nums after the first k are not important.
- Return k, the count of elements not equal to val.

Example:
Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
Output: 2, nums could be [2,2,_,_]

Explanation:
The first two elements of nums are 2, which are the elements not equal to 3.
